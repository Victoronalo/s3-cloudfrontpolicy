Objective:
I am to create an S3 bucket, configure static website hosting, create CloudFront distribution, configure s3 bucket policy and test access restriction.


-I started by logging into my AWS management console.



-I navigated to the S3 on the AWS management console.



-I created an S3 bucket named “s3-cloudfrontproject”.


-I proceeded to enable versioning on the bucket.


-I then uploaded the static web files to the S3 bucket.


-I proceeded to creating a Cloudfront distribution.


-I proceeded to copy the AOC policy to the s3 bucket.


-I proceeded to the management module of the s3 to change policy.


-I tested the website from the cloudfront and it worked


-In the course of doing this project I came across some huddles but with the help of the team and the internet it was successful.


-Also it is worth noting that a lot was learnt in the course of this project.
